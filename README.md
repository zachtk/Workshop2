# Workshop 2: Git

The second workshop of CS326, which covers how to use Git in a group setting.

So what do I even change?
I had no idea there are *italics!!*

MOAR CHANGES!! When I'm feeling lonely! Sad as I can be...
All by myself on an uncharted island in an endless sea.
What keeps me happy, fills me up with glee:
Those bones in my jaw that don't have a flaw...

MY SHINY TEETH AND ME!!
